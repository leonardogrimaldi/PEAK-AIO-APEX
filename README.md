## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Link |
|---|---|---|
| BepInEx | 5.4.23.3 | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3) |
| DearImGuiInjection | Latest | [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/penswer/DearImGuiInjection/) |

> **Important:** Use BepInEx 5.x (not 6.x). The mod targets the BepInEx 5 plugin API.

---

## Installation

### Step 1 — Install BepInEx

1. Download [BepInEx 5.4.23.3](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.3) (x64 for Windows).
2. Locate your PEAK game folder:
   - **Steam:** Right-click PEAK in your Library → Manage → Browse Local Files
3. Extract the BepInEx archive **directly into the game folder** so that `BepInEx/` sits alongside `PEAK.exe`.
4. **Run the game once** and then close it. This generates the required folder structure:
   ```
   PEAK/
   ├── BepInEx/
   │   ├── config/
   │   ├── plugins/
   │   └── ...
   ├── PEAK.exe
   └── ...
   ```

### Step 2 — Install DearImGuiInjection

1. Download [DearImGuiInjection](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/penswer/DearImGuiInjection/) from Thunderstore.
2. Place the `DearImGuiInjection` into `BepInEx/plugins/`.

### Step 3 — Install PEAK AIO

1. Download the latest `PEAK-AIO.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/elliot35/PEAK-AIO-int/releases) page.
2. Place `PEAK-AIO.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`.

### Step 4 — Launch

1. Launch PEAK using **DirectX 12** (not Vulkan).
   - In Steam: Right-click PEAK → Properties → Launch Options → ensure `-dx12` or select DirectX 12 in-game settings.
2. Press **Insert** (default) to open the mod menu.

Your final `BepInEx/plugins/` folder should look like:

```
BepInEx/plugins/
├── DearImGuiInjection
└── PEAK-AIO.dll
```

---

## Opening the Menu

Press the **Insert** key (default) in-game to toggle the mod overlay and cursor. The menu appears as a floating ImGui window with a tabbed sidebar.

To change the hotkey, see [Configuration](#configuration) below.

---

## Configuration

All settings are automatically saved to a BepInEx config file the first time you run the mod:

```
BepInEx/config/com.onigremlin.peakaio.cfg
```

You can edit this file with any text editor while the game is **closed**. Settings you can configure include:

### Menu Toggle Key

```ini
[General]

## Key to toggle the mod menu overlay. Uses UnityEngine.KeyCode names.
# Setting type: KeyCode
# Default value: Insert
MenuToggleKey = Insert
```

To change the hotkey, replace `Insert` with any valid [UnityEngine.KeyCode](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html) name. Common choices:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| Insert | `Insert` |
| Home | `Home` |
| F1–F12 | `F1`, `F2`, ... `F12` |
| Right Shift | `RightShift` |
| Backslash | `Backslash` |
| Numpad 0 | `Keypad0` |

### Language

```ini
[UI]

## Language: 0=English, 1=简体中文, 2=日本語, 3=한국어, 4=Italiano
LanguageIndex = 0
```

You can also change the language in-game from the **LANG** tab.

### Cheat Defaults

Every toggle and slider (stamina, fly speed, jump height, etc.) is saved in the config file. Change default values here to have them pre-set when the game starts.

---

## Feature Guide

### Fly Mode

Enable **Fly Mode** from the Player tab. While flying:
- **WASD** — move horizontally
- **Jump (Space)** — ascend
- **Crouch (Ctrl)** — descend
- Adjust **Fly Speed** and **Fly Acceleration** sliders in the Details panel

### Teleport to Ping

Enable **Teleport to Ping**, then place a map ping in-game. Your character will instantly warp to the pinged location.

### Inventory Editor

Switch to the **Items** tab to:
1. Use the search bar to find any game item by name
2. Select it from the dropdown to assign it to a slot
3. Use the **Recharge** slider and button to restore item charges

### Lobby Controls

The **Lobby** tab lets you interact with other players in your session. Select a player from the dropdown, then use the action buttons. **Spawn Scoutmaster** is host-only and forces the enemy to aggro the selected player.

### World / Containers

The **World** tab lists all luggage and containers within 300 meters. You can remotely open them or teleport to their location.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Menu doesn't appear | Make sure you're running **DirectX 12** (not Vulkan). Check that both `DearImGuiInjection` and `PEAK-AIO.dll` are in `BepInEx/plugins/`. |
| Insert key doesn't work | Another program may be capturing the key. Change the hotkey in the config file (see [Configuration](#configuration)). |
| Game crashes on launch | Verify you're using **BepInEx 5.4.23.3** (not 6.x). Remove any conflicting mods from the plugins folder. |
| Config file doesn't exist | Run the game once with the mod installed. The file is generated automatically at `BepInEx/config/com.onigremlin.peakaio.cfg`. |
| Features don't work in-game | Most features require you to be **in a session** (not on the main menu). Some lobby features require being the host. |
| Fly mode feels sluggish | Increase the **Fly Speed** and **Fly Acceleration** sliders in the Player → Details panel. |
